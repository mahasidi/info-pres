<h2>Providence, RI</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I tried two different drinks from <a href="https://www.ceremonypvd.com/">Ceremony</a>, a caf√© and tea house in Providence. I had the Rose Matcha and the Strawberry
    Matcha. </p>
<p>Here's my opinions:</p>
<p>Rose Matcha</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rose flavor was very faint and didn't add anything to the drink.</li>
  <li>The petals were a nice touch. </li>
  <li>The tea was smooth with a nice milk to tea ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strawberry Matcha</p>
<ul>
  <li>The strawberry flavor was present but not overbearing.</li>
  <li>Overall, the drink had a nice sweetness to it. </li>
  <li>Much better than the Rose Matcha.</li>
</ul>
